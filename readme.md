# CSCI405 Natural Language Processing Project

## Giovanni Ruggirello, Joshua Korang, Jesse Byler, Alex Berger, Donye Wakefield

The purose of this Project is to create a program that detects from a user input. The program will be trained on data and some code provided by [Kaggle's Language Detection Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/martinkk5575/language-detection/notebook)* and use _`Type of Decision Tree`_ Algorithms to detect what language a user is typing into a text box.

_*To support Kaggle, the data is not provided here, but on their own website. Please [download the data there](https://www.kaggle.com/code/martinkk5575/language-detection/notebook) before operating this model!_
