      "第条（「ヤロスラフの法典」）が記載されている。この年を、『ルースカヤ・プラウダ』の原型が成立したとみなす説が、研究史上根強い。また、ヤロスラフがノヴゴロドの人々に法文を与えた背景については以下の考察がある。すなわち、ヤロスラフはスヴャトポルクとの戦いに際しヴァリャーグを傭兵に雇い入れていたが、彼らはノヴゴロドの人々に乱暴を働き、治安の乱れの元ともなっていた（これにより一時ヤロスラフとノヴゴロドの人々との間にも摩擦が生じていた）。そのような状況の元、年のスヴャトポルクとの戦いに臨み、ノヴゴロドのヴェーチェ（民会）は、ノヴゴロド兵の出兵の見返りとして、刑法の布告の約束をヤロスラフに求めていた、という経緯によるものだという指摘である。\n",
